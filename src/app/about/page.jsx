        "Dbay2x" is a reference to the visayan kid's way of saying <strong className="font-bold">"divided by"</strong>. Well, at least it was when I was a kid in the late 90s. Hence, the name for a bill-splitting web app. 
        <br /><br />
        Dbay2x is a web app that aims to simply the process of dividing expenses among friends and calculating the transactions needed for settling balances and debts. 
        <br /><br />
        This is also a mini-project that I wanted to create as a way of practicing my new skills in building web apps using NextJS, TailwindCSS and others.
